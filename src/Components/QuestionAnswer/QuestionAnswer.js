                                <p className="leading-relaxed">Context API is an modern and efficient way to pass data to react child elements. Normally we use props drilling to pass data to lower child. If the child is after 5 parents then we need to pass props to all of these 5 parents to get the data to child. It is quite repeating on same code. Using context API we can simply pass data to any child directly.</p>

                                <p className="leading-relaxed">Semantic tag is a way to describe HTML elements to both machine and human. It converts a HTML elements in several parts like header, main, footer, section, article etc. By looking on corresponding tags we can easily understand in which section of a webpage these tag will be used.</p>

                                <p className="leading-relaxed">Inline-block element is formatted just like the inline element, where it doesnâ€™t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height values. On the other hand the block element will start on a new line and occupy the full width available. And you can set width and height values.</p>
